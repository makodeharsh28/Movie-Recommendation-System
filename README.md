# Movie-Recommendation-System
Overview:
This movie recommendation system utilizes cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system analyzes the textual features of movies (e.g., plot summaries, genres, etc.) to generate recommendations.

How it Works:
* Data Collection: The system is built upon a dataset containing information about various movies, including titles, plot summaries, genres, etc. This dataset serves as the basis for recommendation generation.
* TF-IDF Vectorization: Textual features such as plot summaries and genres are transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This process helps in representing the textual content of each movie in a mathematical form.
* Cosine Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of different movies. Higher cosine similarity values indicate greater similarity between movies.
* Recommendation Generation: When a user inputs their preferences or watches a particular movie, the system computes the cosine similarity between the input movie and all other movies in the dataset. It then selects the top N most similar movies as recommendations.

Usage:
* Input: Users can provide their preferences by specifying a movie title, genre, or any other relevant information.
* Output: The system outputs a list of recommended movies based on the input provided by the user.

Dependencies:
* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy

Getting Started:
* Ensure all dependencies are installed (pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy).
* Clone the repository or download the code files.
* Run the main script, providing necessary input parameters.
* Receive movie recommendations based on the input.

Note:
* The effectiveness of recommendations may vary based on the quality and quantity of the dataset used.
* Further optimization and fine-tuning can be done to enhance recommendation accuracy.
